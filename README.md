![Contrabass Demo (TUI in Action)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junhoyeo/contrabass/main/.github/assets/demo.png)

</div>

Contrabass is a terminal-first orchestrator for issue-driven agent runs. The default mode connects your machine to the Cloudflare-hosted control plane: tracker polling and team coordination run in the cloud while agent execution stays on your laptop. A `--local-only` single-host build is also available as a secondary path for offline or solo use.

## Current scope

Today Contrabass ships with:

- A cloud-hosted control plane (Cloudflare Durable Objects, D1, R2, Queues, Cron) for team coordination, tracker polling, and the live dashboard
- A `contrabass worker` daemon that registers with the cloud, accepts dispatched issues, executes them locally using the existing agent runners, and streams events back
- A cloud dashboard at `https://app.contrabass.dev` for live board, run detail, config history, and worker status — with WebSocket updates and GitHub OAuth login
- A `contrabass migrate cloud` migration tool for seeding the cloud board and workflow config from an existing local project
- A Cobra CLI with TUI, headless, and optional embedded web dashboard modes (local-only build)
- A `WORKFLOW.md` parser with YAML front matter, Liquid prompt rendering, and `$ENV_VAR` interpolation
- Issue tracker adapters for **Linear**, **GitHub Issues**, and a built-in **Internal Board** (local filesystem, no external service required)
- Agent runners for **Codex app-server**, **OpenCode**, **oh-my-opencode**, **OMX (oh-my-codex)**, and **OMC (oh-my-claudecode)**
- Git-worktree-based workspace provisioning under `workspaces/<issue-id>`
- Teams: multi-agent coordination with a local task board, phased pipeline (plan → exec → verify), live TUI team table, and dual worker modes (tmux-based multi-process or goroutine-based in-process)
- An orchestrator with claim/release, timeout detection, stall detection, deterministic retry backoff, and state snapshots
- A Charm v2 terminal UI built with Bubble Tea, Bubbles, and Lip Gloss
- Go unit/integration tests, TUI snapshot tests, and dashboard component/hook tests
- A tmux-based multi-process worker mode alongside the in-process goroutine mode, with JSONL event logging, file-based heartbeats, dispatch queue, governance policies, and crash recovery

## Requirements

- **Go 1.25+**
- **Bun 1.3+** for the dashboard/landing workspace
- **Git** (workspace creation uses `git worktree`)
- **tmux** (required for the default tmux worker mode in team runs; not needed for goroutine mode)
- A supported agent runtime:
  - `codex app-server`
  - `opencode serve`
  - [`oh-my-opencode`](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent)
  - `omx` ([oh-my-codex](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex) team runtime)
  - `omc` ([oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode) team runtime)
- Tracker credentials for the backend you use:
  - Linear: `LINEAR_API_KEY`
  - GitHub: `GITHUB_TOKEN`

From a fresh clone, run `bun install` once before using the JS/landing build and test commands.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install junhoyeo/contrabass/contrabass
```

### Download from GitHub Releases

Pre-built binaries for macOS and Linux (amd64/arm64) are available on the
[Releases](https://github.com/junhoyeo/contrabass/releases) page.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junhoyeo/contrabass.git
cd contrabass
bun install
make build
```

`make build` first builds `packages/dashboard/dist/` and then embeds it into the Go binary.

> **Note:** `go install github.com/junhoyeo/contrabass/cmd/contrabass@latest` works for the
> CLI and TUI, but the embedded web dashboard (`--port`) will be empty because `go install`
> does not run the JS build step.

## Local environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in your Linear project URL, assignee UUID,
and preferred model. Workflow YAMLs in `testdata/` resolve `$VAR` placeholders
from your environment at startup.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your values, then source it:
set -a && source .env && set +a
```

### Per-workflow required environment variables

| Workflow file | Required environment variables |
|---|---|
| `workflow.demo.md` | `CONTRABASS_PROJECT_URL`, `LINEAR_ASSIGNEE_ID`, `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `CONTRABASS_MODEL` |
| `workflow.hardening.md` | `CONTRABASS_PROJECT_URL`, `LINEAR_ASSIGNEE_ID`, `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `CONTRABASS_MODEL` |
| `workflow.omx.md` | `CONTRABASS_PROJECT_URL`, `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `CONTRABASS_MODEL` |
| `workflow.omc.md` | `CONTRABASS_PROJECT_URL`, `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `CONTRABASS_MODEL` |
| `workflow.github.md` | `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_ASSIGNEE`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `CONTRABASS_MODEL` |
| `workflow.ohmyopencode.md` | `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_ASSIGNEE`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `CONTRABASS_MODEL`, `OPENCODE_PROVIDER_API_KEY` |
| `workflow.local.md` | _(none — uses internal board, model is hardcoded)_ |
| `workflow.mock.md` | _(none — test fixture)_ |

## Quick start (cloud mode)

### 1. Enroll your machine

Generate an enrollment code from the [team dashboard](https://app.contrabass.dev) and exchange it for a stored credential:

```bash
contrabass worker login --code <one-time-code>
```

The refresh token is stored in the OS-native credential store (Keychain on macOS, libsecret on Linux, Credential Manager on Windows) and never written to plain disk files.

### 2. Start the worker daemon

```bash
contrabass worker --team <name>
```

The worker detects installed agent runtimes, git, and tmux availability, registers its capabilities with the cloud, and begins waiting for dispatched runs. The assigned worker ID and dispatch channel are printed on startup.

### 3. Monitor from the dashboard

Open **[https://app.contrabass.dev](https://app.contrabass.dev)** and log in with GitHub. The team board shows live run status, worker health, and configuration history via WebSocket updates.

### Migrate an existing local project

If you have a local Contrabass project, seed the cloud board and workflow config:

```bash
# Preview what will be uploaded (no writes):
contrabass migrate cloud --team <name> --dry-run

# Upload after review:
contrabass migrate cloud --team <name> \
  --api-base-url https://api.contrabass.dev \
  --token "$CONTRABASS_MIGRATION_TOKEN"
```

See [`docs/cloud-migration.md`](docs/cloud-migration.md) for full migration instructions, post-migration checks, and rollback steps.

---

## Quick start (local-only mode — supported but secondary)

> **Note:** Local-only mode is a secondary path for offline and solo use. For team workflows, use [cloud mode](#quick-start-cloud-mode) above. Build with `make build LOCAL_ONLY=1` for the local-only binary — see [Build from source](#build-from-source).

### Run with the demo workflow

```bash
LINEAR_API_KEY=your-linear-token \
./contrabass --config testdata/workflow.demo.md
```

### Run with the embedded web dashboard

```bash
LINEAR_API_KEY=your-linear-token \
./contrabass --config testdata/workflow.demo.md --port 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

### Run headless

```bash
LINEAR_API_KEY=your-linear-token \
./contrabass --config testdata/workflow.demo.md --no-tui
```

### CLI flags

```text
--config string      path to WORKFLOW.md file (required)
--dry-run            exit after first poll cycle
--log-file string    log output path (default "contrabass.log")
--log-level string   log level (debug/info/warn/error) (default "info")
--no-tui             headless mode — skip TUI, log events to stdout
--port int           web dashboard port (0 = disabled)
```

#### Team subcommand flags

```text
contrabass team run --config workflow.md [flags]

--worker-mode string   override worker mode (goroutine|tmux, default from config)
```

#### Worker subcommand flags

```text
contrabass worker [flags]

--team string          team name to register under (required)
--ephemeral            use shorter lease defaults for CI / ephemeral runners

contrabass worker login [flags]

--code string          one-time enrollment code generated from the dashboard (required)
```

## How Contrabass works

1. Poll the configured tracker for candidate issues.
2. Claim an eligible issue.
3. Create or reuse a git worktree in `workspaces/<issue-id>`.
4. Render the prompt body from `WORKFLOW.md` using issue data.
5. Launch the configured agent runner.
6. Stream agent events, track tokens/phases, and publish orchestrator events.
7. Retry failed runs with exponential backoff + deterministic jitter.
8. Mirror state into the TUI and, when enabled, the embedded web dashboard.

### Runtime notes

- `WORKFLOW.md` is watched with `fsnotify`; on parse errors, Contrabass keeps the last known good config.
- The Codex runner speaks newline-delimited JSON (`JSONL`) to `codex app-server` rather than `Content-Length` framed messages. See [`docs/codex-protocol.md`](docs/codex-protocol.md).
- The web dashboard currently has live metrics, running sessions, and retry queue data. The rate-limit panel exists, but there is not yet a live rate-limit feed behind it.
- The workflow parser already accepts more Symphony-shaped fields than the runtime fully consumes today. For example, `workspace`, `hooks`, and some `codex` settings are parsed, but the current runtime mainly uses tracker selection, timeouts, retry settings, binary paths, and prompt/template fields.

### Team worker modes

Teams support two worker modes, configured via `team.worker_mode` in the workflow file or the `--worker-mode` CLI flag:

| Mode | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `tmux` | Each worker runs in a separate tmux pane with process isolation, cross-process IPC via JSONL events, and file-based heartbeats | Yes |
| `goroutine` | Workers run as goroutines within the contrabass process — lighter weight, no tmux dependency | |

**tmux mode** (default) provides:

- Process isolation — each agent CLI runs in its own tmux pane
- JSONL event log for cross-process event streaming
- File-based heartbeat monitoring with stale detection
- Dispatch queue with ack tracking and timeout redelivery
- Governance policies with role routing heuristics
- Crash recovery with state diagnosis and automatic cleanup
- Advisory file locking via `flock(2)` for safe concurrent access

**goroutine mode** runs all workers in-process using Go's `errgroup` and `sync.Mutex`. It requires no external dependencies but shares the process address space.

Team state is persisted as JSON files under `.contrabass/state/team/{teamName}/`.

## Workflow file format

Contrabass reads a Markdown workflow file with YAML front matter followed by the prompt template body.

```md
---
max_concurrency: 3
poll_interval_ms: 2000
max_retry_backoff_ms: 240000
model: openai/gpt-5-codex
project_url: https://linear.app/acme/project/example
agent_timeout_ms: 900000
stall_timeout_ms: 60000
tracker:
  type: linear
linear:
  issue_details:
    enabled: true
  sync_comments:
    enabled: false
    mode: reply_thread
agent:
  type: codex
codex:
  binary_path: codex app-server
---
# Workflow Prompt

Issue title: {{ issue.title }}
Issue description: {{ issue.description }}
Issue URL: {{ issue.url }}

Produce code and tests that satisfy the issue requirements.
```

### Linear detail and timeline sync settings

When `tracker.type: linear` is used, the dashboard can load richer issue
metadata through the Contrabass backend without exposing Linear credentials to
browser code.

```yaml
linear:
  issue_details:
    enabled: true
  sync_comments:
    enabled: false
    mode: reply_thread # reply_thread by default; top_level is the fallback-safe mode
```

- `linear.issue_details.enabled` controls backend issue detail reads used by
  the issue detail sheet. Candidate polling remains lean.
- `linear.sync_comments.enabled` is opt-in and defaults to `false`; when
  enabled, durable workflow timeline nodes are projected to Linear comments.
- Comment sync is best-effort and asynchronous. It records retry/sync status in
  local timeline state and does not block issue completion, retry queueing, or
  dashboard rendering.
- Disable `linear.sync_comments.enabled` to preserve legacy direct completion
  comments and avoid any Linear comment projection.

### Template bindings

The current prompt renderer exposes:

- `issue.title`
- `issue.description`
- `issue.url`

### Environment-variable interpolation

String values in YAML front matter can reference environment variables using `$NAME` syntax.

Examples:

- `tracker.token: $GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `opencode.password: $OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD`
- `omx.binary_path: $OMX_BINARY`
- `omc.binary_path: $OMC_BINARY`

### Linear issue details and workflow timeline

For Linear trackers, Contrabass can load richer issue metadata for the dashboard and maintain a local workflow timeline that is projected back to Linear comments only when explicitly enabled.

```yaml
tracker:
  type: linear
linear:
  issue_details:
    enabled: true
  sync_comments:
    enabled: false
    mode: reply_thread # or top_level
```

- `linear.issue_details.enabled` defaults to enabled for Linear trackers and is ignored for non-Linear trackers.
- `linear.sync_comments.enabled` defaults to `false`; comment sync is best-effort and opt-in.
- `linear.sync_comments.mode` defaults to `reply_thread`; use `top_level` when threaded replies are unsupported or undesired.
- Workflow timeline files are local Contrabass state and remain the source of truth even when Linear sync is disabled or temporarily fails.

### OMC / OMX workflow sections

For team-runtime-backed runners, set `agent.type` to `omx` or `omc` and configure the corresponding section.

```yaml
agent:
  type: omx
omx:
  binary_path: omx
  team_spec: 2:executor
  poll_interval_ms: 1500
  startup_timeout_ms: 22000
  ralph: true
```

```yaml
agent:
  type: omc
omc:
  binary_path: omc
  team_spec: 2:claude
  poll_interval_ms: 1200
  startup_timeout_ms: 21000
```

Notes:

- `binary_path` can point to the installed CLI wrapper, for example `omx` or `omc`.
- `team_spec` is passed directly to the team runtime, such as `1:executor`, `2:executor`, or `2:claude`.
- Contrabass writes the rendered task prompt into `.contrabass/runner/<runner>/...` inside the workspace and instructs the team runtime to execute from that file.
- OMC/OMX team runners generally require the underlying toolchain prerequisites those CLIs expect, especially tmux-based team support.

### Team configuration

The `team` section configures multi-agent coordination:

```yaml
team:
  max_workers: 5
  max_fix_loops: 3
  claim_lease_seconds: 300
  state_dir: .contrabass/state/team
  execution_mode: team    # team | single | auto
  worker_mode: tmux       # tmux (default) | goroutine
```

- `worker_mode`: Controls how agent workers are spawned. `tmux` (default) uses separate tmux panes with process isolation. `goroutine` runs workers in-process.
- `execution_mode`: Controls coordination strategy. `team` uses the full phased pipeline, `single` runs one agent at a time, `auto` selects based on task count.

### Example workflow files

- [`testdata/workflow.demo.md`](testdata/workflow.demo.md) — demo Linear + Codex workflow
- [`testdata/workflow.github.md`](testdata/workflow.github.md) — GitHub + OpenCode workflow
- [`testdata/workflow.ohmyopencode.md`](testdata/workflow.ohmyopencode.md) — oh-my-opencode workflow
- [`testdata/workflow.omx.md`](testdata/workflow.omx.md) — OMX workflow
- [`testdata/workflow.omc.md`](testdata/workflow.omc.md) — OMC workflow
- [`testdata/workflow.md`](testdata/workflow.md) — realistic Linear fixture

### Tunables

Fine-grained runtime knobs you can set in your workflow YAML front matter.
All values are in milliseconds unless noted. Omitting a key uses the default.

| YAML key | Default (ms) | Why you'd change it |
|---|---|---|
| `web.sse_keepalive_interval_ms` | `15000` | Increase if your reverse proxy has a shorter idle-timeout than 15 s |
| `codex.handshake_timeout_ms` | `30000` | Increase on slow networks where `codex app-server` takes longer to start |
| `codex.overload_retry_cap_ms` | `4000` | Raise the backoff ceiling if your codex tier is heavily rate-limited |
| `codex.overload_start_delay_ms` | `100` | Tune the first-retry delay for overload (-32001) responses |
| `team.restart_grace_period_ms` | `5000` | Time allowed for a worker to shut down cleanly before forced restart |
| `team.governance_retry_delay_ms` | `500` | Pause between governance-check retries in the worker loop |
| `team.heartbeat_interval_ms` | `10000` | How often the coordinator scans for stale workers |
| `tracker.http_timeout_ms` | `30000` | HTTP timeout for Linear / GitHub API calls |
| `tracker.main_ref` | `"main"` | Git ref searched for already-implemented commits; set to `origin/main` if you don't maintain a local main branch |
| `tracker.auto_close_already_implemented` | `false` | When `true`, issues whose identifier appears in `main_ref` commits are automatically transitioned to Done (Linear only) |

## Supported integrations

| Surface | Current support |
|---|---|
| Trackers | Linear, GitHub Issues, Internal Board |
| Agent runners | Codex app-server, OpenCode, oh-my-opencode, OMX, OMC |
| Cloud dashboard | `https://app.contrabass.dev` — board, run detail, config history, worker status (WebSocket + GitHub OAuth) |
| Operator surfaces | Charm TUI, embedded web dashboard (local-only), headless mode |
| Live config reload | Cloud: WebSocket `config-changed` push; local-only: `WORKFLOW.md` via `fsnotify` |
| State streaming | Cloud: WebSocket subscription with `last_event_id` replay; local-only: JSON snapshot API + SSE |

### Trackers

- **Linear**
  - GraphQL-based issue fetch, claim, release, state update, and comment posting
  - Can auto-resolve the assignee from the API token when `tracker.assignee_id` is omitted
- **GitHub Issues**
  - REST-based issue fetch, assign/unassign, comment, and close-on-release behavior
  - Pull requests are skipped when fetching issues
- **Internal Board**
  - File-based local issue tracking under `.contrabass/board/` — no external service required
  - Supports team-scoped boards for multi-agent coordination
  - See [`docs/local-board.md`](docs/local-board.md) for format details

### Agent runners

- **Codex**
  - Launches `codex app-server`
  - Performs `initialize` → `initialized` → `thread/start` → `turn/start`
  - Streams newline-delimited JSON notifications and usage updates
- **OpenCode**
  - Starts or reuses an `opencode serve` process
  - Creates sessions over HTTP and streams events over SSE
- **oh-my-opencode**
  - Wraps the `oh-my-opencode` agent binary
  - HTTP session creation with SSE event streaming
- **OMX (oh-my-codex)**
  - Launches `omx team ...` with a workspace-scoped task file
  - Polls `omx team api get-summary` and `omx team api list-tasks` for status and results
  - Shuts down the team with `omx team shutdown ... --force` (and `--ralph` when configured)
- **OMC (oh-my-claudecode)**
  - Launches `omc team ...` with a workspace-scoped task file
  - Polls `omc team api get-summary` and `omc team api list-tasks` for status and results
  - Shuts down the team with `omc team shutdown ... --force`

## Web dashboard and HTTP API (WIP)

When `--port` is set, Contrabass serves the embedded dashboard and a small JSON/SSE API.

### Current endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/state` — full orchestrator snapshot
- `GET /api/v1/issues/{issue_id}/details` — cached issue plus backend-only Linear detail data when available
- `GET /api/v1/issues/{issue_id}/timeline` — local workflow timeline snapshot for the issue
- `GET /api/v1/{identifier}` — cached issue lookup from the latest snapshot
- `GET /api/v1/events` — SSE stream (initial snapshot + live orchestrator events)
- `POST /api/v1/refresh` — currently returns `202 Accepted` as a placeholder hook

The dashboard currently renders:

- connection status
- aggregate runtime/token metrics
- running session table
- retry queue
- issue detail sheets with Linear metadata and workflow timeline rows when those APIs are available

## Development

### Build and test

```bash
make build            # build dashboard, then build ./contrabass
make build-dashboard  # build packages/dashboard/dist only
make build-landing    # build packages/landing/dist only
make test             # go test ./... -count=1
make test-dashboard   # bun test in packages/dashboard
make test-landing     # astro check in packages/landing
make test-quick       # recommended local validation path
make test-all         # Go + dashboard tests + landing checks
make ci               # lint + test-quick + binary/dashboard build + landing build
make lint             # go vet ./...
make clean            # remove built artifacts
make release-dry      # dry-run GoReleaser locally (skips publish)
```

For day-to-day local validation, use `make test-quick`.
For a fuller pre-push or CI-style pass, use `make ci`.

### Dashboard development

```bash
make dev-dashboard
make dev-landing
```

The repository is a root Bun workspace with `packages/dashboard` and `packages/landing`.
The Astro landing site renders `README.md`, so this file is both repo documentation and site content.

### Running from source

```bash
go run ./cmd/contrabass --config testdata/workflow.demo.md --port 8080
```

## Releasing

CI and release workflows run automatically via GitHub Actions:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — runs on every push and PR: lint, test, build
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — triggered by pushing a version tag

To ship a new release:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

This builds cross-platform binaries (macOS/Linux, amd64/arm64) via [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com),
publishes a GitHub Release with grouped changelogs, and updates the
[Homebrew tap](https://github.com/junhoyeo/homebrew-contrabass).

After GoReleaser publishes the release, [`scripts/generate-release-notes.ts`](scripts/generate-release-notes.ts)
appends contributor attribution — each change is tagged with the author's `@username` and linked PR,
and first-time contributors get a dedicated shout-out section.

## Notes for contributors

For detailed contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- The dashboard assets must exist before the Go binary is built because the binary embeds `packages/dashboard/dist`.
- `packages/landing` renders `README.md`, so README changes also affect the landing site.
- If workspace package resolution looks broken in `packages/dashboard` or `packages/landing`, rerun `bun install` at the repository root to refresh workspace links.
- TUI snapshots live in `testdata/snapshots/` and are exercised by `internal/tui` tests.
